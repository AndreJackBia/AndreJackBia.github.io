## About me

I'm a twenty-four years old computer scientist interested in software engineering and cutting-edge technologies.
I'm also interested in sci-fi movies and TV series, from which I take inspiration for the future.
I strongly believe that technology makes the world a better place to live, so I make the main core of my life out of it.
